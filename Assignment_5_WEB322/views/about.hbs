        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Ali Riza Sevgili, and I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in building dynamic and user-friendly applications. I am currently pursuing my studies in web development and continuously strive to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. I believe that web development is not just about coding, but also about creating seamless experiences for users.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into the world of technology began with a simple curiosity about how websites work. Over the years, I have transformed that curiosity into a deep understanding of modern web technologies and frameworks. I have worked on various projects that include everything from creating simple static websites to developing complex backend systems using Node.js and Express. My goal is to continuously learn and grow as a developer, while contributing to impactful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source software. Working in teams and contributing to community-driven projects has taught me the value of sharing knowledge and working together towards a common goal. It has also helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, enabling me to tackle challenges efficiently and effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am focusing on building full-stack applications that can scale and adapt to users' needs. This includes learning about new frameworks, understanding cloud deployment, and implementing best practices for security and performance. I am also passionate about making websites accessible and user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their abilities or devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about the latest trends in the tech world, and participating in hackathons. These activities help me stay up-to-date with industry developments and keep my creative thinking alive. I am excited about the future of web development and the endless possibilities that come with it.
